<h2> Overview </h2> 

<p> 
This research aims to translate an expressive gesture performed on one musical instrument to another. The goal is to
match the target instrument's gestures as closely as possible while preserving the natural characteristics of the source
instrument. The synthesis is generated from a sequence of audio samples from a database of performances on the source instrument.
Applications of this method include information retrieval using audio queries, source separation by humming/singing, 
and humming-to-instrument synthesis.

<h2> Violin-to-bassoon synthesis </h2>
<p>
A violin performance is synthesized on the bassoon with the goal of
matching the violin's musical gestures. 
The example below demonstrates the synthesis program applied to the opening of the 
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/absolute-sibelius-violin-concerto/id328298349"> Sibelius violin concerto</a>.
The bassoon database was generated using recordings by a professional bassoonist (many thanks to Professor Kathleen McLean, professor of bassoon
at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music). For comparison, recordings are added of the 
same bassoonist performing the Sibelius excerpt, imitating the violin's expressive gestures, and of a Garage Band synthesis of the same melody. </p>

<p> For evaluation of the results, all recordings were temporally aligned 
using <a href="http://colinraffel.com/publications/icassp2016optimizing.pdf" > dynamic time warping </a> and
 <a href="http://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=89293&sid=8cb83b3154a498c35093da5beafa0795"> normalized </a>
to have the same average loudness and all silent sections were removed. Additionally, a recording of the same excerpt was 
generated on <a href = "http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/" > GarageBand's</a> synthesized bassoon.</p>
